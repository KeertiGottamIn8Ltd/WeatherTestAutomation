Example

Gherkin for any requireement is as below. 

Feature: As a User
 
 Given I should be in weather report site   
    So that I can see weather for any city
       
   
   Scenario Outline: Check the city weather for 5 Days
    
    Given I am in WeatherSite
    
    When I enter city city as <city>
    
    And I click on <day>
    
Examples:
  
  | city      | day       |
  
  | Edinburgh | Tuesday   | 
  
  | Glasgow   | Wednesday | 

The above example expalins how to do we write a feaure file to display the Weather of a city on Selected Day basis. 

**This is just an example, its not actual test. Actual tests are in the /resources folder.

Documentation

I have added only SRC , POM.xml, README.md files only so that anyone can import to any IDE and create as Maven project. 
Used Page Object Model as a Design pattern of the project so that we can abstract and reuse the code efficiently.
Tried to refactor as much as we can reuse at the same time maintained the reaability of the code.
